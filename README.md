## Store API

## Project Overview
The main objective of this project was to learn how to design and implement a web API. The application is designed to manage users and roles effectively, catering to both clients and store owners.

- **Backend**: The backend, built with .NET Web API 6.0, handles various operations and integrates with Azure AD B2C for comprehensive user and role management. This ensures secure authentication and authorization for both clients and store owners.
  
- **Client Side**: On the client side, Blazor WebAssembly offers a rich, interactive user experience. The combination of .NET Web API 6.0 and Blazor WebAssembly provides seamless functionality for the users.


## Key Features
- **RESTful .NET Web API**: Developed a RESTful API using ASP.NET Core to handle various client and store owner operations.
- **gRPC Service**: Implemented a sample gRPC service to demonstrate the use of modern, high-performance RPC framework alongside RESTful services.
- **Azure AD B2C Integration**: Integrated Azure AD B2C for comprehensive user and role management, allowing seamless authentication and authorization.
- **JWT and Bearer Tokens**: Secured API endpoints using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and Bearer tokens to ensure that only authenticated users can access the services.
- **Postman Testing**: Conducted extensive testing of the API endpoints using Postman to ensure reliability and performance.
- **OpenAPI Documentation**: Documented the API using the OpenAPI format to provide clear and comprehensive API documentation.
